      "content": "Human Genomics data sharing is an increasingly complex task. Researchers need to juggle legal, ethical and intellectual requirements, along with publishing and funding responsibilities. Although the majority of researchers want to do the right thing, navigating the maze of data, tool, workflow and protocol repositories; software, protocol, metadata and infrastructure standards is not an easy task. Let alone staying up to date with major genome projects and support agencies that can help them on their quest. The Human ‘Omics Data Sharing Field Guide seeks to provide a comprehensive resource that gathers together essential information on a broad range of topics to help Australian researchers on their genomics data sharing journey. We consider this a work in progress and would welcome your feedback and contributions. See the Contribute page for further info on how to contribute to this project. ",

Expression matrices can also be submitted to ArrayExpress. Each dataset is curated to ensure it meets the ArrayExpress MAGE-TAB metadata standard for the particular type of experiment and data being submitted. As raw data is stored in the ENA and made available openly, it is not suitable for data that requires controlled access. It is possible to create submissions in ArrayExpress that contain openly available metadata along with a summary expression matrix and link to raw data in the EGA to allow for more discoverability of controlled access functional genomic datasets via ArrayExpress. Many ArrayExpress experiments have ‘ExpressionSet’ objects that can be downloaded and loaded directly into R. They can also be accessed through the ‘ArrayExpress’ Bioconductor package (Kauffmann, Emam, and Schubert 2022; Kauffmann et al. 2009).

It is flexible to store any kind of key value pair and values can be linked to ontologies. Multiple BioSamples can be linked together, for example, a virus sample could be linked to a sample from its host through a ‘Derived from’ relationship. Samples may also be linked under a project by specifying a ‘project’ key. Samples can be linked to EGA projects if sample metadata provided is openly accessible (e.g. https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/samples/SAMEA4940335 ). Metadata can be submitted and queried via their REST API. There is a python wrapper though it is not actively maintained.

Ownership of data remains with the original data providers, but the INSDC requires free and unrestricted access to all data records without use restrictions, licensing requirements or fees for use (Arita et al., 2020). It is composed of three nodes: . The European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) The DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) GenBank . Data submitted to each node must adhere to the INSDC data and metadata standard. This standard is implemented in a set of XML schemas. The shared data model enables each archive to mirror all data submitted to any INSDC node. Archival accessions provided by each archive follow a consistent pattern with node specific lettering used based on where the data was originally submitted, ‘E’ for ENA, ‘D’ for DDBJ and ‘S’ for GenBank (see ENA Accession numbers documentation for more information). While not part of the INSDC, the China National Center for Bioinformation (CNCB) and its National Genomics Data Center (NGDC) provide archives that follow the same themes and data standards as those part of the INSDC (CNCB-NGDC, 2019). They also mirror the metadata of data within INSDC archives, enabling global search across all four major genetic sequencing archives. Table 1.

Controlled access means that anyone who wants to use the data, must apply for access to the data and agree to use the data in accordance with a data use policy. It varies whether that repository has its own Data Access Committee (DAC) that decides whether a data access request (DAR) complies with the policy and access is granted, or whether the data remains under the control of a dataset specific DAC. Within Australia, the need to keep data onshore and the challenges involved in archiving in major international repositories means the majority of Australian human genomics research data remains siloed and un-FAIR in unsearchable institutional repositories. However, of the major controlled access archives, the European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA) is the most used archive by Australian researchers, as it is the only one available to researchers without the need for specific funding arrangements or explicit approval.

      "title": "EGA Submission process",
      "content": "The EGA submission process can be challenging to those unfamiliar to it, so the following sections provide an overview as well as some tips and tricks that may help you along the way. The first step is to gain an EGA submission account, which can be done by completing the submission account form. EGA Metadata . The metadata files that must be submitted to EGA follow the same INSDC schemas, with the addition of policy, dataset and dac objects. These allow for the administration aspects related to controlled access of data and allow for finer grained access to datasets within a study. All information submitted in these XML files is considered public access and can be queried via the EGA API once the study is available in the platform. The required attributes that must be included about each sample are: . Donor ID - anonymised individual identifier Biological sex (referred to as gender) Phenotype - preferably ontologised using EFO . Submitters can add as many other attributes as they like, but this information will be openly accessible when the study is submitted. It is also possible to first submit attributes to the BioSamples database first and use the obtained accessions in your EGA submission to link to BioSamples. These would also only be for public metadata. Due to limited required attributes, it is often necessary to make more comprehensive clinical, phenotypic and demographic metadata available alongside the data files. If this metadata is subject to controlled access, the information can be attached to the submission as Analysis (phenotype) files. These do not follow any kind of strict standard or format, however the use of the GA4GH phenopacket is an emerging standard for characterising this type of information. README files can also be incorporated to provide an explanation of the phenotype or other analysis files. Submitting to the EGA can be done via its submission interface or through submitting XMLs or JSONs via their REST API. The submission interface is useful for a user-friendly experience when submitting metadata for objects where there are relatively few objects of that type. We recommend using it for objects such as: . Study DAC Policy Experiment . For objects with a high cardinality, such as Samples, Runs and Analyses, using the CSV templates that are available through the submission portal or creating XML documents and submitting via API is more efficient. However, it is possible to create a fully automated submission process that contains all metadata required by creating XML documents. Submission notes: . Warning: When preparing a submission, it is important to validate and check all the details because editing after submission is not possible without going through the helpdesk. Submission to the test instance of the EGA is recommended before making your final submission. Tip: Use recognisable values for the aliases. The alias field that is set for each object is not strictly required, if not specified one will be provided. BUT the alias is what you used to link between the different objects so it is useful to set to names that you can recognise to facilitate the linking that is required in your submission. Aliases must be unique across all items within a submission account. Important: All data files that are referred to by ‘run’ or ‘analysis’ objects must be placed in the submission box and indexed by the system before it will allow submission of those object XMLs. Note: For objects that are linked by their accessions i.e. policy, dataset, the objects they refer to must be submitted and assigned accessions by the EGA before they can be linked.

Example of automated data flow to EGA from QIMRB. This transforms their internally stored metadata into the XMLs required for an EGA submission: https://github.com/delocalizer/ega_metadata . EGA Data Files . All files that will be referenced from the Run or Analysis objects must be encrypted before they are transferred to the EGA servers. Encryption is done by using the EGAcryptor software and you need the public key provided by EGA. The files must be checksummed both before and after encryption, and the checksums as well as the method used must be incorporated into the metadata files. File can be transferred using Aspera (faster) or FTP. They don’t generally allow for more than 10TB of data to be uploaded to a submission box at a time, but this can be negotiated with the helpdesk if a higher limit is needed. Warning: Ensure that any potentially identifiable information is take out of any data files, such as information in BAM headers Note: Once files are uploaded, it takes time for them to be indexed and recognised as present within the submission box. Submission of file-related metadata won’t be possible until the EGA system recognises the files are in the submission box. Tip: File names should be kept in a simple flat structure when uploading and ideally shouldn’t change names as changes in names may take up to 24 hours to change. Tip: There may be limits on the bandwidth of data that can be uploaded to a submission box but this is unknown. Be prepared for timeouts, dropouts and don’t over burden with lots of parallelisation. Note: The transfer process can be very slow from Australia-&gt;Europe Important: It is expected that you will complete your submission, including metadata from the entire experiment, within 60 days of uploading files to a submission box, and files will be deleted after 90 days. So don’t upload files unless you are ready to complete your submission. Resources: . EGA file upload documentation: https://ega-archive.org/submission/tools/ftp-aspera .

As well as being an extremely important resource in its own right, it aims to be a healthy reference dataset that many researchers can use to supplement their own research data. Raw, curated data that is part of the Human Cell Atlas is coordinated and made available through the HCA Data Portal. It contains a variety of directly contributed and manually curated datasets from various sources. Much of the data is openly available with both raw data files and expression matrices. Studies with controlled access requirements provide an expression matrix with raw data files available by applying through the normal data access process for either dbGaP or EGA depending on where the study was submitted. The majority of datasets are single-cell sequencing experiments, largely generated from 10x and SmartSeq experiments. Data can be explored via the UI or through APIs. All data in the portal adheres to the HCA Metadata Standard which is comprehensive and explained in detail on the portal. HCA data can also be explored via a number of other portals including: . | Cambridge Cell Atlas - A portal generated by the Gene Expression Atlas team from EBI that offers cross project gene searching and visualisation of datasets via annotated tsne and umap plots | The UCSC Cell Browser - A portal generated by the University of California Santa Cruz to visualise annotated cell types through UMAP plots | The Single Cell Portal - A portal generated by the Broad Institute to visualise expression data and download summary information | The covid19 cell atlas - https://www.covid19cellatlas.org/ | The EBI HCA Project Catalogue - A curated catalogue of cellular resolution projects with pointers to publications and where data is stored | https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/ - data can be explored visually in cell x gene and also with a gene expression matrix | . The HCA is open to submission for any cellular resolution research data that can contribute to building a healthy atlas of human cells. Further information about how to contribute data can be found via the data portal. Studies that are yet to be archived can be brokered to EBI repositories (BioStudies, BioSamples and ENA) by the HCA team. ",

But institutions may only apply for funding from the NHMRC if they declare that all their research complies with the National Statement. Failure to meet the requirements of the National Statement could have repercussions for employment, professional misconduct claims or even an action in the tort of negligence. It is a guiding principle of the statement that participation in research must be voluntary and participants must be well informed about the research and its implications. Researchers who share genomic data must try to minimise the likelihood of re-identifying individuals from the data. Chapters 2.2 and 2.3 of the National Statement deal with consent and qualifiers and waivers of consent. Chapter 3.3 deals with genomic data. Chapter 4.7 addresses considerations related to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. ",
